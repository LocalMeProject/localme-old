/**
 * Vitest setup, loaded before any test module.
 *
 * The suite must never touch the developer's own database. `.env.local` is
 * loaded into every shell in the workspace, so `DB_PATH` pointed at
 * `data/localme.db` meant `npm test` opened the *real* development
 * database — and the cleanup in a test file silently deleted it.
 *
 * Each worker therefore gets its own in-memory SQLite. The Postgres leg
 * (`npm run test:postgres`) deliberately sets DB_DRIVER=postgres with its own
 * throwaway URL, so it is left untouched.
